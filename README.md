## Learning Goals

Palette Picker is a project designed for developers to use multiple environments including the development, testing, and continuous integration environments, as well as solidify their knowledge of server-side testing and connecting a front and backend with CORS.

Additionally, this project was intended for students to really dive deep into utilizing issues, templates, and code reviews to effectively collaborate on a project and to mimic a real-world environment. (Another environment! ðŸ’ª)
